# Placitum — Build Progress & Handoff

> For the next AI agent: read `placitum-implementation.md` first (it is authoritative),
> then this file. Work one phase at a time; do not start Phase N+1 code until Phase N's
> CI gate is green (Section 0, rule 5).

## Environment

- **No node/npm on the host.** Everything runs inside the nix dev shell:
  - `nix develop` — interactive shell (node 22 + npm)
  - `nix develop --command npm run ci` — one-shot gate
  - Fresh clone: `nix develop --command bash -c "npm ci && npm run ci"`
- `flake.nix` provides **only** `nodejs_22`. All JS deps come from npm (Section 8.3
  allow-list); the shell never needs rebuilding for dep changes.
- `flake.nix` / `flake.lock` are registered with `git add -N` (intent-to-add) so nix
  flakes can see them in the git tree. Do not commit unless the user asks.

## Status

| Phase | State | CI gate |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — Scaffolding & test harness** | **DONE** | green (2026-09-15) |
| 1 — Lexer | next | — |

Gate runs, in order: `check-deps` → `tsc --noEmit` → `eslint .` → `vitest run`
(= `npm run ci`). Last verified: 5/5 tests passing, all checks proven adversarially (below).

## Phase 0 DoD checklist

- [x] `tsconfig.json` in place; `tsc --noEmit` passes.
- [x] `.eslintrc.json` in place; import boundary **proven to fire**: a temporary
  `src/evil-import-fixture.ts` importing `fs` failed with
  `1:1 error 'fs' import is restricted ... no-restricted-imports` (exit 1), then was deleted.
- [x] `scripts/check-deps.mjs` fails the build on non-allow-listed direct deps.
      **Failure path proven:** injecting `left-pad` into the lockfile root entry →
      `check-deps: dependencies outside the Section 8.3 allow-list:\n  left-pad`, exit 1;
      lockfile restored byte-perfect (`cmp`), happy path re-verified.
- [x] `npm run ci` chains `check-deps` → `tsc` → `eslint` → `vitest`.
- [x] 3 negative fixtures in `tests/capability/negative/`, each schema-validated
  against `PlacitumErrorSchema` by `tests/phase0/expected-errors.test.ts`.
      **Pairing check proven:** an orphaned `orphan.negative.placitum` (no expected-error
      sibling) failed both the set-equality test and the per-script validation; then removed.

### "Otherwise-empty src/" interpretation

The CI gate says "green on an otherwise-empty `src/`", but the fixtures must validate
against `PlacitumErrorSchema` — so `src/` holds exactly one file: `src/shared/errors.ts`
(the Section 9.3 envelope). No other src/ code exists; this is the minimal reading.

## Deviations from placitum-implementation.md (all user-approved; md already updated)

1. **`tsconfig.rootDir: "."`** (was `./src`). As written, Section 8.2 rejected
   `tests/**` with TS6059 even under `--noEmit`. Section 8.2 in the md is fixed.
2. **ESLint override paths prefixed with `src/`** (`src/host-bindings/**`,
   `src/capability/guard.ts`) — overrides are repo-root-relative; Section 3's tree
   lives under `src/` per the tsconfig `include`. Md updated.
3. **`tests/**` override also disables `no-restricted-imports`.** Golden-file tests
   must read fixtures via `node:fs`; the import boundary guards the language
   runtime, not the test harness. Md updated.
4. **`@types/node` added to the Section 8.3 allow-list** (dev, types-only).
   Without it `tsc` cannot type `node:fs` / `URL` / `import.meta.url` in any TS
   test — every phase's golden tests require it. Md + `check-deps.mjs` updated.
5. **Version pins to keep Section 8.1 byte-exact:** `eslint@8.57.1` +
   `@typescript-eslint/*@^7` (v8 removed `recommended-requiring-type-checking`;
   eslint 9 ignores `.eslintrc.json`). Known cost: eslint 8 is EOL and its
   transitive dev deps carry 5 `npm audit` findings (dev-only, no runtime ship).
   Upgrade path: migrate to flat config + ts-eslint v8 when the spec's config
   format is revisited.

## Decisions within spec latitude

- **`check-deps` audits direct dependencies only** (package-lock root entry:
  `dependencies` + `devDependencies` + `optionalDependencies`).
  Transitive deps are pinned by the lockfile itself; a literal full-lockfile audit
  against the 9-package allow-list is impossible (eslint alone pulls ~80 transitives).
- **`traversal.negative.placitum` implies a Phase 3 glob requirement:** for the literal
  `/safe/../etc/passwd` to statically pass under `needs fs.read("/safe/**")`, the glob
  compiler must support `**` (crossing `/`); a single `*` must NOT cross `/` (classic
  glob semantics, per the spec's `/etc/config/*.json` example). Build that into
  `shared/` glob-to-regex in Phase 3.
- **Deps installed so far:** zod, typescript, eslint stack, vitest, @types/node.
  `commander` (Phase 9), `tsx` (iteration), `prettier` (formatting) deferred until needed.
- **Fixture error-code choices** (fixtures are inert until their phase wires them up):
  - `traversal.negative.placitum` → **E403**. `needs fs.read("/safe/**")` string-matches
    the literal `/safe/../etc/passwd` statically, so extraction passes and the guard's
    realpath must catch the escape — exactly Phase 4's naive-string-match test class.
  - `net-star.negative.placitum` → **E305** (bare `*` rejected at extraction).
  - `uncovered-bang.negative.placitum` → **E301** (literal target, no covering needs).
- No GitHub Actions — CI gate is the local `npm run ci` (user's call; revisit when
  remote gating is needed).

## Next: Phase 1 — Lexer (DoD in Section 11)

Hand-rolled scanner, source string → `Token[]`. Key requirements:
- Every token carries exact `line`/`col`/`span` (see `BaseNode`, Section 7.1).
- Stateful `f"...{expr}..."` lexing (expression mode inside `{ }`, nested braces,
  `\{`/`\}` escapes).
- `#!` pragma only on physical line 1; bare `#` starts a line comment anywhere.
- `BANG` token only directly after an identifier/member chain, no whitespace;
  any other `!` position → `E104`.
- Maximal munch: `||` before `|`, `==` before `=`.
- Goldens: `tests/lexer/*.lex.golden.json` (≥1 per token category); negatives E101–E106.
- TDD per Section 0 rule 1: fixtures first, watch them fail, then implement.
- Error classes (`LexError` etc., Section 9.3) land here — extend from a common
  `PlacitumErrorBase` in `src/shared/`.
